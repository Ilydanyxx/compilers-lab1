1. Language accepted by the automaton:

The language consists of all words over the alphabet {a, b} that:
- contain at least one 'a', and
- contain at least one 'b', and
- the first 'a' appears before the first 'b'.

Formally: L = { w ∈ {a, b}* | ∃ i < j such that w[i] = 'a' and w[j] = 'b' }

2. Why it is not deterministic:

The automaton contains a state with multiple outgoing transitions labeled by the same symbol (e.g., two 'a' transitions from the same state), or ε-transitions (transitions without consuming input), which means the next state is not uniquely determined by the current state and input symbol.

3. Determinised automaton (DFA):

States: { S0, S1, S2 }

Transitions:
- S0 --a--> S1
- S0 --b--> S0
- S1 --a--> S1
- S1 --b--> S2
- S2 --a--> S2
- S2 --b--> S2

Start state: S0
Accepting state: S2

Explanation:
- S0: no 'a' seen yet
- S1: first 'a' seen, waiting for first 'b'
- S2: both 'a' and 'b' seen, first 'a' was before first 'b'
